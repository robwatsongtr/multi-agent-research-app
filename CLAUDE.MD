# Claude Code Guidelines

## General Standards

See CODING_STANDARDS.MD for implementation and documentation standards that apply to all projects.

## Claude Code Behavior

Do not ask follow up questions or ask if something "makes sense." Just execute the prompt. 

Do not ask any questions like "Ready to implement feature x....." at the end of responses.
