# Claude Code Guidelines

## Project References

@CODING_STANDARDS.MD - Technical standards and requirements
@PLAN.MD - Phased implementation plan

## Development Workflow

This project follows a phased, iterative development approach:
- Work through features phase by phase as outlined in PLAN.MD
- Complete each phase before moving to the next
- Follow all technical standards defined in CODING_STANDARDS.MD
- **Implement tests after completing each phase** - Write tests for all new functionality before moving to the next phase

## Claude Code Behavior

Do not ask follow up questions or ask if something "makes sense." Just execute the prompt.

Do not ask any questions like "Ready to implement feature?" at the end of responses.
